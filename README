WCL OVERVIEW
------------
Common Lisp implementations for Unix have traditionally provided a
rich development environment at the expense of an inefficient delivery
environment.  The goal of WCL is to allow hundreds of Lisp
applications to be realistically available at once, while allowing
several of them to run concurrently.  WCL accomplishes this by
providing Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that can be linked with
Lisp and C code to produce efficient applications.  For example, the
executable for a Lisp version of the canonical ``Hello World!''
program requires only 20k bytes on 32 bit x86 Linux.  WCL also
supports a full development environment, including dynamic file
loading and debugging.  A modified version of GDB is used to debug WCL
programs, providing support for mixed language debugging.  The
techniques used in WCL should also be applicable to other high-level
languages that allow runtime mappings from names to objects.
