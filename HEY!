-----------------------
deal with static allocation in rtalloc and write_barrier

start with static_allocate just does regular alloc?

Need to align closure OE pointer on an 8 byte boundry or use metadata to scan.

pass in RTscan_memory as arg to root scanner, eliminate extern RTscan_memory

Eliminate black_count_lock - replace with black_scanned and black_alloc counts.

write group_verifier and all_groups_verifier.

write group_verifier first, check group 32 on every alloc an bin search

LP copy_c_to_lisp_string(char *str) was writing 1 byte too far! - changed it.
    try adding back more padding!

Need to alloc closures with special md data


HEY! fix identify_free_pages to work with obj > 1 page in len
