this call overwrites at 495 count:

t0 = ICALL(s_lsp_INITIALIZE_2DARRAY_2DFROM_2DCONTENTS) (MV_CALL(argc,3), v_A_0, v_UNDERLYING_2DARRAY_1, v_INITIAL_2DCONTENTS_5);

-----------------------
start with static_allocate just does regular alloc
BUT, static allocation doesn't seem to be used any more.

pass in RTscan_memory as arg to root scanner, eliminate extern RTscan_memory

no need to apply write barrier to closures - env pointer is never updated after
closure is created.

write barrier here:
in compiler-init.lisp:

  (defprimitive %32bit-def ((x t) (i int) (y t) => ()) ; unsigned
    (emit-c "(LP) (DEREF(~A + ~A * sizeof(LP)) = (LD) ~A)" x i y))

    (emit-c "(LP) write_barrier(&(DEREF(~A + ~A * sizeof(LP))),(LD) ~A)" x i y))
