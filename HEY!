this call overwrites at 495 count:

t0 = ICALL(s_lsp_INITIALIZE_2DARRAY_2DFROM_2DCONTENTS) (MV_CALL(argc,3), v_A_0, v_UNDERLYING_2DARRAY_1, v_INITIAL_2DCONTENTS_5);

p mcheck_check_all()

-----------------------
start with static_allocate just does regular alloc
BUT, static allocation doesn't seem to be used any more.

pass in RTscan_memory as arg to root scanner, eliminate extern RTscan_memory

write barrier here:

trampoline writes ptr into OE var - should need wcl_wb call.
Avoid this by adding OE scan to thread stack scans, treat it like the stack

;;; I assume these are stack writes in emit-code.lisp:
stack write? (emit-c "~A = NEW_OE(~D);~%"
ditto: 	 (emit-c  "~A = OE;~%" oe-var))))))
ditto:   (emit-c "~A = MAKE_CLOSURE(~A,~A);~%"
