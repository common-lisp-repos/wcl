This directory contains a port to WCL of Richard Waters 8/31/90
implementation of the xp pretty-printer. The functionality provided by the
pretty printer is documented in Chapter 27 of Cltl2.

TO COMPILE: Type "make install" or see compile-script.lisp
TO LOAD: (load "load-script.lisp")

The pretty printer functions are exported from the XP package.
However, you must reference them explicitly rather than trying to
(USE-PACKAGE "XP") because the XP functions conflict with functions
exported from the LISP package. Thus, you must say XP:PPRINT you want
to use the pretty printer.  This will be fixed when the pretty printer
is integrated into the library.  However, before including this code
in libwcl, it needs more work to reduce top-level initializations.
Then the functions in the interface file should replace corresponding
wcl functions.
