TO INSTALL
----------

As root in the wcl/linux directory, type 
	
	make install

The command "wcl" should then invoke wcl.

If you don't have root access or for some reason the wcl executables cannot find the needed libraries, explicitly say where to find them (i.e):

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/wade/wcl/lib


TO COMPILE FROM SOURCE
----------------------
In the same directory as this file do the following:

make rebuild

This runs the current binaries from directories called called dist-bin and
dist-lib and places the newly compiled binaries in bin and lib.
