TO INSTALL
----------

As root in the same directory as this file, do the following:
	
	make install

The command "wcl" should then invoke wcl.

If you don't have root access or for some reason the wcl executables cannot 
find the needed libraries, explicitly say where to find them (i.e):

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/wade/wcl/lib


TO COMPILE FROM SOURCE
----------------------
In the same directory as this file do the following:

make

This runs the current binaries from directories called called dist-bin and
dist-lib and places the newly compiled binaries in bin and lib.
